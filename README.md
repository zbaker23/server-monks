## Purpose

The goal of servermonks is to compare COVID-19 vaccination data for
California with the results, by county, of the 2021 CA Gubernatorial
Recall Election. In [a CNN
article](https://www.cnn.com/2021/08/28/politics/california-recall-what-matters/index.html)
analyzing the context behind the recall election, Ethan Cohen (Reston
and CNN) is quoted saying that:

"$$Although political groups in CA launched efforts to oust Gov.Â Newsom
before the pandemic, the$$quest to collect enough signature petitions to
force a recall election took off late last year amid anger about
Newsom's Covid-19 stay-at-home orders and other restrictions. And while
the governor appeared to be in a strong position to withstand the effort
for much of this year, the resurgence of the pandemic $$with the delta
variant$$ and frustration with the state's wildfire, drought and
homelessness crises has injected an unexpected level of volatility into
the race in an overwhelmingly blue state."

The functions and tidy datasets included in this package will thus
empower users to ask questions about the different ways in which
counties in California have responded to the pandemic.

## Target audiences:

Public and private entities who are interested in looking at a
relationship, if any, between trends in the polarized political races we
saw during the course of the pandemic

## Installation

You can install the development version of servermonks from Github with
the following code:

``` r
devtools::install_github("zbaker23/server-monks")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to use the print() base R
function within our servermonks package to visualize the ballot_question
dataset. For the ballot measure question of, "Shall Gavin Newsom Be
Recalled (Removed) From the Office of Governor?" for the 2021 CA
Gubernational Recall Election, this dataset details the number of "yes"
votes, the number of "no" votes, the percentage of the votes that are
"yes", and the percentage of the votes that are "no" by county.

``` r

library(servermonks)
